Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in. My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. You can act like a man! When they come... they come at what you love.

My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! That's my family Kay, that's not me. I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.

I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. Te salut, Don Corleone.
